The project is for NYC Taxicab Cloud ETL pipeline. The project primarily focuses on Graph modelling, and how we can integrate graph data science into traditional analytical problems and solve in a much more efficient way. We can utilize algorithms like Dijkstra's (Single source shortest path), Page rank (developed by Google) etc.
The primary objective is to perform a real time streaming of NYC taxicab dataset through Kafka and transform the data into Graph and load on Neo4j. Neo4j has features like properties for nodes and relationships through which can perform various analysis on the data points.
